#URI Design
- "Nouns are good, Verbs are bad"
  - E.g. 'getCustomers' vs 'saveCustomers'
    - doubles the work, one should use the **words** of the HTTP stakc and be resource based
  - Prefer plurals, e.g. 'api/Customers' and 'api/Games'
 - Use identifier to locate individual items in URI
   - does not have to be internal key
     - e.g:
	   - api/customers/123
	   - api/games/halo-3 (-> isn't a primary/internal key)
	   - api/invoices/2003-01-24 (here it's the date)
- **Status Codes** (not a complete list, but most common)
  - **200**
    - 200: OK
	- 201: Created
	- 202: Accepted
  - **300**
    - 302: Found
	- 304: Not Modified
	- 307: Temp Redirect
	- 308: Perm Redirect
  - **400**
    - 400: Bad Request
	- 401: Not Authorized
	- 403: Forbidden
	- 404: Not Found
	- 405: Method Not Allowed
	- 409: COnflict
  - **500**: Internal / Server Error(s)
  - At minimum use codes 200 (it worked), 400 (you did sth wrong) and 500 (we did sth wrong)
- **Formatting** results
  - Content Types, header *accept*
    - application/json -> json data
	- text/xml -> xml data
	- application/javascript -> JSONP (requires callback param e.g. /customers/?callback=foo)
	- application/xml+rss -> RSS
	- application/xml+atom -> ATOM
